Potential risk: 
Similary as people have been manipulated during the Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal, we could do the same by advertising specific pivotal movies. We could advertise a specific movie as pivotal whe
to influence them through movie. For example, if we want someone to vote more on the right we could chose a movie were all the bad guys are strangers and are terrorists then we would advertise it as pivotal movie
. We would then show advertisement for voting more on the right. Or we could prepare video with a chosen candidate for president and we would show video where he says he wans to close the borders.  
 The influence the public the the left political side we could involve showcasing films that depict the terrible conditions of civilians in war zones or life in extrem poverty.
