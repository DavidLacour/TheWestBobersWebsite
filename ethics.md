Drawing a parallel with the manipulative tactics observed in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, a similar approach could theoretically be applied in the realm of cinema to sway voters' opinions. The initial step would involve pinpointing individuals susceptible to changing their political stance. Subsequently, these individuals could be subtly influenced through strategically chosen films. For instance, to nudge someone towards a more right-leaning perspective, a film could be selected where the antagonists are foreigners involved in terrorism, subtly reinforcing certain political narratives. This movie could be marketed as a groundbreaking and influential film. In conjunction with this, targeted advertising could be used to promote right-wing voting. Additionally, creating and circulating videos featuring a specific presidential candidate espousing policies like border closure could further reinforce this political leaning. Such a strategy hinges on the psychological impact of media and narrative framing on voting behavior.
